# Creoline

Programming language based on the Cape Verdian creole.

## Description

The Creoline programming language was created with the aim to have a programming language which is at the same
time easy for Cape Verdeans to understand, while keeping the same versatility as more known languages as
C or Golang.

As noted above, the main inspirations for the syntax of this programming language were C and Go, but other
languages as Rust and Liquid played a good role when designing it.

For more concrete specifications about the language read the [BNF Language Spec](./docs/BNF-Language-Spec.md).

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Usage

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.
