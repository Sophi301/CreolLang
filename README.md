# CreolLang

**CreolLang** or **Creol** is a programming language based on the **Cape Verdian Creole**. It was made to be easy for anyone who understands Cape Verdean Creole while keeping the same versatility as some other languages, such as C, Go, and Rust.

## Description

The syntax of this programming language was initially based on C, Go and Rust, but other programming languages such as Liquid played a good role in the initial design.

For more concrete specifications about the language, you are recommended to read the [CreolLang Language Specification](./docs/creol-lang-spec.md).

### More:

The file extension of the CreolLang programming language is **.crl** and the compiler's name is **creol**.
